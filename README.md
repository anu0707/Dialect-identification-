Dialect is particular form of a language which has its own speaking pattern, vocabulary,grammar and pronunciation. It is specific to speakers who are members of a certain social or geographic group.
Cultural backgrounds, social classes, economic standing,levels of education, and other variables all play a major role in determining these changes. It is a challenging task due to high similarity amongst
the dialects of a language.

To solve the problem of dialect identification we use TDNN based x-vector, BLSTM based u-vector and Transformer based u-vector. The Transformer-based u-vector that applies attention at 3 levels 
performs the best.

This repository contains the code for x-vector based DID system, BLSTM based u-vector and Transformer-based u-vector.
